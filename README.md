Blog 1: Workings of docker engine https://medium.com/@jawad633/introduction-b1368365c1d2

The Docker Engine blog describes Docker's transition from a 
monolithic architecture to a modular structure, splitting the 
daemon into distinct components: Docker CLI, Daemon, Containerd, and Runc. This modular approach 
enhances Docker's efficiency and reliability, allowing better management of container lifecycles and
interactions with the host system.
